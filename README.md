# ops-survey-planning

Pretty much all research we have about trends in IT operations are assimilated by vendors of computer companies.
They want your email addresses, and they want to answer questions they can use in marketing materials.
That's all fine, I guess, but how do we really learn new things?

This repo is here to facilitate an issue tracker only - add to the one ticket is there in the comments with ideas
on things you would like to know.

At some point, we'll get a REALLY awesome SurveyMonkey survey out there and try to learn as much as we can.

Let's test all the crazy ideas and see what is really true, what people are really using, what ideas are popular and what are not, and what kinds of new things need to exist.
